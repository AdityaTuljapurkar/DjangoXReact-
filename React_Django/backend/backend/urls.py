# TokenObtainPairView is used to create and return a new pair of tokens: an access token and a refresh token when a user authenticates (logs in). This view is the standard way to obtain these tokens by providing valid user credentials.
#TokenRefreshView  Uses a separate refresh token to obtain a new access token. The refresh token itself has its own expiration time. Once the refresh token expires, the user must re-authenticate (log in again) to get new tokens. The access token cannot be refreshed indefinitely without re-login.
